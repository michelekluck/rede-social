<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a simple, text-focused social network. Users must log in to access the platform, where they can create, edit, and delete their posts. The goal is to provide a minimalist experience, free of distractions, highlighting only textual content. The project was developed to apply concepts like authentication and CRUD operations in a practical and functional way.</p>
